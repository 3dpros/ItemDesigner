<p>We are building face shields for local medical professionals using a 3D printed headpiece and a thin plastic laminate shield.&nbsp; These are intended to be easily producible, and provide good protection while being able to produce as many as possible.</p>
<h2>Source for shield face</h2>
<p>Current plan is transparency sheets, but TBD</p>
<h2>3D printable files for shield headpiece</h2>
<p>Current Baseline Design:<br /><a href="/covidFiles/Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_LETTER_v3_1.STL">Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_LETTER_v3_1.stl</a></p>
<p>Modification A: Larger contact points to reduce pressure points in extended use: <br /><a href="/covidFiles/Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_LETTER_v3_1_comfort.STL">Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_LETTER_v3_1_comfort.STL</a></p>
<p>Modification B: Reenforced edges near front for added strength:<br /><a href="/covidFiles/3holeverk_modified_arm.stl">3holeverk_modified_arm.stl</a></p>
<p>Recommended Print Settings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>PETG Material - can be sterilized with bleach, and does not have known skin reactions</li>
    <li>thick layers (~.3 for .4mm nozzle) to maximize speed.  Can increase further with larger nozzles</li>
    <li>245C nozzle temp to improve strength</li>
</ul>
