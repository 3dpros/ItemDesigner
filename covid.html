<h1>Covid-19 Shield Project (Austin, TX)</h1>
<p>We are building face shields for local medical professionals using a 3D printed headpiece and a thin plastic laminate shield.&nbsp; These are intended to be easily producible, and provide good protection while being able to produce as many as possible.</p>
<h2>Source for shield face</h2>
<p>Current plan is transparency sheets, but TBD</p>
